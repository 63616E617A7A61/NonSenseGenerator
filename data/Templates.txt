The %n  %v  a %a  %n  
The %a  %n  saw the %a  %n  and decided to %v  
The %n  %v  the %a  %n  in a %a  %n  
We %v  that the %n  was too much.
A %a , %a , and %a  %n was spotted near the %n  when they were %v  
%a  %n  %v  %a  %n  
%n  %v  %a  %n  in the %a  %n  
When the %n  %v , the %a  %n  %v 
The %a  %n  %v  but the %a  %n  %v  
If %n  %v , then %n  will %v  
Both the %a  %n  and the %a  %n  %v  
The %n  %v  because the %a  %n  %v  
In the middle of the %a  %n , the %n  suddenly began to %v  
The %n  often ends up having to %v  again
